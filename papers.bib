abstract  ="We study the origins of multiple mechanically stable states exhibited by an elastic shell comprising multiple conical frusta{,} a geometry common to reconfigurable corrugated structures such as ‘bendy straws’. This multistability is characterized by mechanical stability of axially extended and collapsed states{,} as well as a partially inverted ‘bent’ state that exhibits stability in any azimuthal direction. To understand the origin of this behavior{,} we study how geometry and internal stress affect the stability of linked conical frusta. We find that tuning geometrical parameters such as the frustum heights and cone angles can provide axial bistability{,} whereas stability in the bent state requires a sufficient amount of internal pre-stress{,} resulting from a mismatch between the natural and geometric curvatures of the shell. We provide insight into the latter effect through curvature analysis during deformation using X-ray computed tomography (CT){,} and with a simple mechanical model that captures the qualitative behavior of these highly reconfigurable systems."}

	abstract = {We explore a surprising phenomenon in which an obstruction accelerates, rather than decelerates, a moving flexible object. It has been claimed that the right kind of discrete chain falling onto a table falls faster than a free-falling body. We confirm and quantify this effect, reveal its complicated dependence on angle of incidence, and identify multiple operative mechanisms. Prior theories for direct impact onto flat surfaces, which involve a single constitutive parameter, match our data well if we account for a characteristic delay length that must impinge before the onset of excess acceleration. Our measurements provide a robust determination of this parameter. This supports the possibility of modeling such discrete structures as continuous bodies with a complicated constitutive law of impact that includes angle of incidence as an input.}
