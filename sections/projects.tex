{Rail neutral temperature measurement (VAST lab, 2019 - Present)}{}
{My thesis project, funded by the Federal Rail Administration (FRA), is to develop a non-destructive method \\for measuring stress in rail roads. Buildup of thermal stresses can cause buckling, an extremely \\ dangerous and expensive phenomenon, so the administration is interested in tracking the temperature at which the rail is under neutral stress. Our solution involves using low-frequency wave propagation to measure the dispersion characteristics of the rail; while these dispersion characteristics make the analysis more complicated than traditional ultrasonic testing, they offer significant improvements in the sensitivity of the measurement to the stress.}{}
